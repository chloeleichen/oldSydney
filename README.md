### Data and cppyright of the photos

This web app uses part of a photo collection by the [State Library of New South Wales](http://data.gov.au/organization/about/statelibraryofnewsouthwales) called [Photographs of Sydney before 1885](http://data.gov.au/dataset/photographs-of-sydney-before-1885). 
> The collection contains over one thousand photographs of Sydney streets, public buildings, views of the Harbour, suburbs etc., chiefly pre 1885. For this project I selected part of the collection that are clearly dated and can be attributed to an author/authors.
